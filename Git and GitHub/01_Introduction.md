## Why Use Git and GitHub?

- **Version Control:** Track changes to your code over time.
- **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously.
- **Backup:** Keep your code safe and accessible from anywhere.
- **Integration:** Works with other tools and services to automate workflows.

**Explanation:**

Imagine you are coding, and your code is working fine. You close your laptop and the next day, you mess up your code, and it stops working. You wish you could go back to when it was working fine. This is where Git helps - it tracks changes in the code (and does much more). You can add a new feature by creating a new branch, and anything you code in the new branch won't affect the main branch.

- **Master (the main branch)**
- **New-Feature (the feature branch)**

When you are happy with your new feature, you can merge your new branch with the main branch.
