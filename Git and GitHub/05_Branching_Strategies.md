# Branching Strategies

## Trunk-Based Development

- **Trunk-Based Development:** Focuses on having a single main branch, often referred to as the `trunk` or `main`. Developers commit to this branch frequently, ensuring that the codebase is always in a deployable state. If branches are used, they are short-lived and quickly merge back into the trunk.

## Feature Branching Development

- **Feature Branching Development:** Involves creating a dedicated branch for each feature, which may be long-lived or short-lived. This strategy allows multiple features to be developed in parallel without affecting the main branch. Features are merged back into the main branch once they are complete and tested.

## Branching Best Practices

- **Create Descriptive Branch Names:** Use meaningful branch names that reflect the purpose or feature being developed.
- **Delete Unused Branches:** Once a branch has served its purpose and its changes have been merged into the main branch, consider deleting it to keep the repository clean and manageable.

Choose the branching strategy and practices that best suit your project's needs. Both trunk-based and feature branching have their advantages and can be selected based on the project requirements.

## Develop and Main Branches

- **Main Branch:** Stores the official release history and contains stable code.
- **Develop Branch:** Acts as an integration branch for features, serving as a testing ground for new features.
